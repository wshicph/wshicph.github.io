            description: "The introductory course to programming at UCPH primarily focuses on F# with a bit of Python towards the end of the course. As of 2022, the main lecturer, Jon Sporring, uses his own course notes as material for the course, and the lectures are adequate. The course is fairly easy for experienced programmers but challenging for beginners. Graded as pass/fail.",

            description: "An introductory course to discrete mathematics, algoritms and data structures. Covers elementary logic and set theory, asymptotic analysis and basic data structures and sorting algorithms. Taught by Mikkel Abrahamsen, who in my opinion is a great lecturer. The course if of adequate difficulty - Graded as pass/fail.",

            description: "An introductory course to software design and software development in C#. I was personally not the biggest fan of this course. The lectures were not the greatest, and a lot of the material can easily be self-taught / learned during employment. The practical component of this course consisted mainly of game development.",

            description: "Attended in 2023 and taught as TA in 2024. Introductory course to human-computer interaction and interaction design. The lecturer, Kasper HornbÃ¦k, mainly uses his own notes/course book. The course is mainly theoretical and covers several concepts in HCI e.g. user-centered design and system evaluation. It is not very hard to pass the course, but to get a high grade requires good grasp of concepts reviewed in this course.",

            description: "Probably my favorite course in the Bachelors. Covers Gaussian elimination, matrix operations, bases for vector spaces, orthogonality, determinant, eigenvalues, complex numbers, and diagonalization. Includes some practical implementation in python. The course is well structured and taught very well (perhaps not very surprising as it is offered by the institut of mathematics). Difficulty is adequate.",

            description: "Covers servaral concepts in machine architecture, operating systems, and computer networks. Practical component of this course is done in C. I quite enjoyed this course, but beware that this course covers quite a lot of topics - this aspect made the exam pretty difficult. I recommend not falling behind in the course schedule.",

Course is taught by the institute of mathematics and quite well structued. The course is not very difficult, and in my opinion of the easier courses in the Bachelors (perhaps even the easiest).",
